## About The Project
There are many Pomodoro timer apps, but many of them lack of a way to keep you on track of your tasks and how well you are managin your time. At the end of the day all we want it's to have more time fro things we enjoy and make our working time as productive as we can and that's what Taskodoro aims to offer.

Here's why you should use Taskodoro:
* Your time should be focused on archieving your tasks :ballot_box_with_check:
* You shouldn't be wasting time because you are not following a work flow :clock1:
* Following kaizen philosofy makes you improve at least 1% every day, THAT'S 31,18% BETTER A YEAR! :chart:

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

How to use the app:
  - When opened you have to sign up or log in if you already have an account
  - In the menu screen you can choose between creating a new session or viewing the sessions logs (will be empty if you don't have sessions). You can also choose to log out.
  - When choosing to create a session you have to enter a name for it and if you want the tasks you would be completing on that session.
  - In the session screen you have the timer and the option to customize the timer value, once the timer ends it will change to the break time and vice versa.
  - If you go back to the manu screen and click on the sessions logs button you will see the session you just created and since you finished you can also see the timer you spent on that session.
